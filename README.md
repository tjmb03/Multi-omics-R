# Multi-Omics Integration in R
## MOFA2 • DIABLO • iCluster • WGCNA • Bayesian Networks

### Biomarker Discovery • Disease Stratification • Survival Modeling

This repository contains multi-omics integration workflows built in R, designed for:

-Biomarker discovery

-Cross-omics latent factor modeling

-Survival association analysis

-Network inference

-Translational systems biology

The repository integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data using both unsupervised and supervised multi-omics approaches.
